            <h2>🔥 Welcome to the Sudoku Challenge! 🧩</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>🎯 Your mission: Fill every row, column, and 3x3 box with numbers 1 to 9.</li>
                <li>🚫 No duplicates! Each number must appear only once in a row, column, or 3x3 grid.</li>
                <li>📋 Some numbers are already there to guide you—don't change those clues!</li>
                <li>🧠 This is a logic puzzle, not a guessing game. Think strategically before placing a number.</li>
                <li>🔍 Double-check your moves—one mistake can throw the whole board off!</li>
                <li>🌟 Pro tip: Work on the easiest rows, columns, or grids first to build momentum.</li>
                <li>🕹️ Take breaks if needed—it's about fun, not frustration! Come back with a fresh mind. 😊</li>
                <li>🔄 Stuck? Tap "Solve" for a helping hand or "Reset" to start a new challenge.</li>
                <li>💪 Ready for a real brain workout? Try solving without any hints. Show off your skills! 💡</li>
                <li>🎉 Remember, the journey is as fun as the finish. Relax, play, and enjoy every victory. You've got this! 😎</li>
